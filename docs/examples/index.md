The following sub-sections contain several examples of basic usage, hosted on
[CodePen](https://codepen.io).

The `examples` directory in the project root also contains some examples which
you can run locally.  To build and run those examples using a local development
server, run either

    $ npm start

or

    $ yarn start


and then point your browser to `localhost:8080`.
