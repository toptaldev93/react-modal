# onRequestClose Callback

This example shows how you can use the `onRequestClose` prop with a function to perform actions when closing.

This is especially important for handling closing the modal via the escape key.

Also more important if `shouldCloseOnOverlayClick` is set to `true`, when clicked on overlay it calls `onRequestClose`.
